 # HTML & CSS Box Model Practice – Responsive Web Page
## Overview
This project is a practice exercise designed to demonstrate the proper use of HTML and CSS, including the Box Model, selectors, and responsive layout. The page showcases structured content with headings, navigation, sections, service cards, and a call-to-action section.

## Files
- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the page structure.
- **styles.css**: The external CSS stylesheet with all styling rules applied.

## Features
- **HTML Structure**: Proper use of semantic elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
- **CSS Box Model**: Clear implementation of `padding`, `border`, and `margin`.
- **Selectors**: Use of element, class, and pseudo-class selectors.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes using media queries.
- **Visual Styling**: Consistent colors, spacing, and hover effects for interactive elements.

## Instructions
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe the layout, styling, and responsiveness.
4. Edit `styles.css` if you want to modify styles or experiment with the Box Model.

## Notes
- The page is fully in **English**.
- Designed to be a simple but functional example for learning HTML and CSS fundamentals.
- No external libraries or frameworks are used; all styling is done with plain CSS.
